# A-Project-on-Robotic-Manipulation-and-Computer-Vision 

Developed an autonomous robotic system for sorting and stacking colored blocks using computer vision and robotic manipulation, titled A-Project-on-Robotic-Manipulation-and-Computer-Vision. The system employed camera calibration techniques to estimate extrinsic parameters, allowing conversion from pixel to world coordinates for accurate object localization. Object detection algorithms identified and tracked blocks of specified sizes and colors within the cameraâ€™s field of view, while forward and inverse kinematics enabled precise positioning and control of the gripper during pick-and-place operations. A state machine managed task sequencing for sorting and stacking actions, integrated with motion planning to generate collision-free trajectories for the manipulator. The project was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing OpenCV for vision processing and custom libraries for kinematic computations, delivering a complete pipeline from perception to action for reliable, structured robotic manipulation.
